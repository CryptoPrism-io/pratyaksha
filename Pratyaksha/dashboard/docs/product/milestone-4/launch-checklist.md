## Product Hunt First Comment Template

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! I'm [Name], maker of Pratyaksha.

**The Problem:** I've journaled for years but never saw patterns
until it was too late. Anxiety would build up over weeks without
me noticing.

**The Solution:** Pratyaksha connects to your journal (Airtable)
and uses a 4-agent AI pipeline to analyze emotional patterns,
energy states, and internal contradictions. Think of it as a
"mind dashboard."

**What's Unique:**
- 10 scientifically-inspired visualizations
- Privacy-first (your data never leaves Airtable)
- Built on CBT frameworks
- Beautiful 3D interface (try the brain!)

**Who It's For:** Anyone practicing self-reflection, CBT, or
just curious about their mental patterns.

I'd love your feedback! What would YOU want to see in a
cognitive analytics tool?
```

## Hacker News Strategy

### Post Details
- **Title:** "Show HN: Pratyaksha – Visualize emotional patterns from your cognitive journal"
- **Time:** Saturday morning 8-10 AM PST (lower competition)
- **Link:** Demo URL in title

### First Comment (Post Immediately)
```
Hey HN! I built Pratyaksha after 2 years of cognitive journaling
helped me identify anxiety patterns my therapist confirmed.

Tech stack: Next.js 15 + React Three Fiber + Airtable + OpenRouter.

The interesting part is the 4-agent pipeline:
1. Intent Agent: Classifies entry type
2. Emotion Agent: Analyzes sentiment + energy shape
3. Theme Agent: Extracts contradictions
4. Insight Agent: Generates recommendations

10 visualizations including Sankey flows, radar charts, and
GitHub-style heatmap. The 3D brain is eye candy but tests well.

Open to technical questions! Code snippets available.

Demo: https://pratyaksha.app
```

### Response Strategy
- Answer EVERY comment within 1 hour
- Focus on technical credibility
- Prepare answers for:
  - "How does AI pipeline work?"
  - "What about privacy?"
  - "How is this different from Notion/Obsidian?"
