## Key Meta-Insight

> **Users don't just want to log - they want to understand themselves.**

The app should evolve from:
- **Logging tool** → **Self-understanding system**
- **AI summaries** → **Pattern recognition**
- **Single entries** → **Connected journey**

**Differentiator:** Not the logging itself, but showing users their own patterns they can't see themselves.
