## User Archetypes Identified

## Key Strategic Insights

### 1. **Engagement ≠ Profile Completion**

- HYPERVERSE: 33 entries, 20% profile
- **Insight:** Crisis users skip onboarding. Need post-crisis flow.

### 2. **Intervention Timing is Critical**
- Crisis users need immediate support, later growth transition
- Explorers need early vision clarity to prevent abandonment

### 3. **One Product, Multiple Use Cases**
- Crisis processing tool
- Identity exploration tool
- Growth tracking tool
- Creative project documentation
