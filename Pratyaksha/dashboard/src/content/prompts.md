2. **Variations:** Generate 3-4 variations of each, pick best
3. **Touch-ups:** May need subtle color correction to match exact brand colors
4. **Testing:** Preview on both light and dark backgrounds before finalizing
5. **Fallbacks:** CSS gradients as fallback while images load

## Implementation

```tsx
// Example usage in component
<picture>
  <source
    srcSet="/images/hero-dark.webp"
    media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
