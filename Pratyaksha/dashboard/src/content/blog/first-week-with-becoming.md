Starting a new journaling practice can feel daunting. How much should you write? What should you focus on? Will this actually help?

Here's what a typical first week with Becoming looks like.

## Day 1: The Brain Dump

**What to write**: Whatever's on your mind right now. Don't filter. Don't organize. Just type.

**How long**: 5-10 minutes is plenty. Don't set a word count goal.

**What you'll see**: Your first analysis might feel surprisingly accurate - or completely off. Both are useful data. If it's accurate, you'll feel seen. If it's off, pay attention to what it missed - that tells you something too.

**Pro tip**: Write at the same time you'd normally check social media. Same impulse, better outcome.

## Day 2: Something Specific

**What to write**: Pick one situation from the past 24 hours that stirred emotions. Describe what happened and what you felt.

**How long**: 5-7 minutes.

**What you'll notice**: The system starts identifying your "mode" - are you processing, planning, or reflecting? Early entries establish your baseline patterns.

**Pro tip**: Include the feeling, not just the facts. "I was annoyed" tells us more than "The meeting ran late."

## Day 3: A Recurring Thought

**What to write**: Something that's been on your mind repeatedly. A worry, a hope, a decision you're weighing.

**How long**: 5-10 minutes.

**What emerges**: Themes start appearing. The dashboard might show your first patterns forming - energy levels, recurring topics, initial contradiction signals.

**Pro tip**: If you're not sure what to write, ask yourself "What keeps coming back?"

## Day 4: Rest Day (Optional)

**What to write**: Nothing, if you don't feel like it. Or a single sentence about how you're doing.

**Why**: Consistency matters, but pressure kills practice. Missing a day is fine. The goal is sustainable habit, not perfection.

**What happens**: Nothing breaks. Your data is still there. The patterns continue building when you return.

## Day 5: Energy Check

**What to write**: How's your energy? High, low, scattered, focused? What's affecting it?

**How long**: 3-5 minutes.

**What you'll see**: The energy shape analysis becomes meaningful. Are you rising toward something? Depleted? Chaotic with too many threads?

**Pro tip**: Energy patterns often predict mood better than mood tracking itself.

## Day 6: A Question

**What to write**: Something you're trying to figure out. Not a journaling prompt - a real question you're living with.

**How long**: 5-10 minutes.

**What emerges**: Questions reveal contradictions. "Should I stay or go?" often contains "Security vs. Growth." The analysis might name what you're wrestling with.

**Pro tip**: Don't try to answer the question. Just explore it.

## Day 7: Reflection

**What to write**: What's been different this week? Any insights, surprises, or observations about your own mind?

**How long**: 5-10 minutes.

**What you'll see**: With 5-6 entries, the dashboard starts showing meaningful patterns. Your most common themes, typical energy level, dominant modes.

**Pro tip**: Look at the aggregated view, not just individual entries. Patterns are the point.

## What Most People Discover

After a week, users commonly report:

- **"I didn't realize how often I think about X"** - Theme frequency is eye-opening
- **"My energy follows a predictable pattern"** - Daily or weekly rhythms become visible
- **"I'm always in the same contradiction"** - Recurring tensions surface
- **"I write more than I expected"** - The friction of starting is the hardest part

## Common First-Week Questions

**"What if my entries are boring?"**
There's no boring. There's only honest and dishonest. Write what's actually on your mind, even if it seems mundane.

**"Am I doing it right?"**
If you're writing authentically, yes. There's no format to follow.

**"The analysis seems off sometimes"**
It will improve as the system learns your patterns. Flag entries that feel wrong - this feedback helps.

**"I don't want to write every day"**
Then don't. 3-4 entries per week still generates valuable patterns. Twice a week is the minimum for meaningful trends.

## The Compound Effect

Day 1 gives you a snapshot. Week 1 gives you a trend. Month 1 gives you insight. The value compounds over time.

Most journaling fails because people expect immediate transformation. Becoming works because it makes long-term patterns visible, which keeps you engaged enough to continue.

## Start Now

You don't need to wait for the right moment. Open the dashboard, set a timer for 5 minutes, and write what's on your mind.

The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is now.
