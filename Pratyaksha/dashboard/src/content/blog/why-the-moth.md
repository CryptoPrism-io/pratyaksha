When we set out to build Becoming, we knew the visual identity had to mean something. Not a trendy gradient or abstract shape, but a symbol that captures what personal transformation actually feels like.

We chose the moth.

## Not the Butterfly

The butterfly gets all the glory. It's the universal symbol of transformation—bright, celebrated, obvious. But the butterfly's metamorphosis happens once, dramatically, and then it's done. Caterpillar to cocoon to butterfly. A clean, Instagram-worthy arc.

Real personal growth isn't like that.

Real growth happens in the dark. It's repetitive. It's quiet. Nobody applauds. You don't emerge with iridescent wings and a new life. You emerge slightly different, still yourself, still working at it.

That's the moth.

## Drawn to the Light

Moths are famous for one thing: flying toward light sources. People call it a flaw, a glitch in their navigation. But look closer.

The moth doesn't crash mindlessly into the flame. It circles. It approaches. It retreats. It tries again. The moth is *pulled* by something it doesn't fully understand—and it keeps pursuing it anyway.

Sound familiar?

When you journal about your goals, your aspirations, the person you want to become—you're circling a light. You don't have a map. You can't see the full path. But something pulls you forward, and you keep flying toward it.

Becoming is built for people who are drawn to something they can't fully articulate yet.

## Night Workers

Moths work at night. While the world sleeps, they're active—pollinating flowers, serving as food for other creatures, playing their role in the ecosystem. Nobody sees them. There's no audience.

The most important work of self-improvement happens the same way. It's the late-night journaling when you finally admit what's bothering you. It's the quiet morning where you decide to try again. It's the internal shift that nobody witnesses but changes everything.

Our AI agents work in the background, analyzing patterns you can't see yourself. Like the moth's midnight labor, the insights emerge without fanfare—but they're real, and they matter.

## The Metamorphosis That Never Ends

Here's what most people don't know: moths don't transform once. Many species go through multiple life stages. Some shed their skins repeatedly even as adults. The moth's becoming is ongoing.

You don't become the person you want to be and then stop. There's no final form. Every entry you write, every pattern you notice, every small adjustment you make—it's another iteration. Another molt. Another version of you, slightly closer to the light.

Becoming isn't a destination. It's a process. The moth understands this.

## Soft Persistence

Watch a moth at a window. It doesn't ram the glass with dramatic force. It flutters. It taps gently. It rests, then tries again. There's no violence in its persistence, just an endless, soft determination.

The best journaling practice isn't intense. It's not "transformative writing breakthroughs" every session. It's showing up, writing what's true, and trusting the pattern to emerge. Gentle persistence. The moth's way.

## Wings That Absorb Light

Butterfly wings reflect light outward in brilliant colors. Moth wings do the opposite—many species have evolved to absorb light, to disappear into the darkness, to move unseen.

Your journal is private. Your patterns are your own. Becoming doesn't broadcast your journey or gamify your growth. The insights we generate are for you, not for an audience. Like the moth, the work is internal, hidden, yours alone.

## The Moth in Our Product

You'll notice moths throughout Becoming:

- **The cursor moth** follows you through the experience, a small companion on your journey
- **Baby moths spawn** when you engage deeply, flying to words that matter
- **The gentle flutter** when something connects—a visual reminder that small movements create change

These aren't decorations. They're reminders of what we believe about growth.

## What the Moth Knows

The moth knows something the butterfly doesn't: transformation isn't an event. It's a practice.

Every night, the moth rises. Every night, it flies toward what calls to it. There's no grand finale, no moment of triumphant arrival. There's just the work—quiet, persistent, drawn by light.

When you open Becoming to write, you're doing the same thing. You're showing up in the dark, circling something you're trying to understand, trusting that the practice itself is the point.

The moth doesn't know if it will reach the light. It flies anyway.

So do you.
